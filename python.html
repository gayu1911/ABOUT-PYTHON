<p>
    Python is a versatile, high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It's used in various fields, including web development, software development, data science, and machine learning. Python is interpreted, meaning code is executed line by line, and is dynamically typed, allowing you to assign
     different data types to variables during runtime.
